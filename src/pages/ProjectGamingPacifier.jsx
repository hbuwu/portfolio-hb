            <h2>What?</h2>
            <p>The Gaming Pacifier is a project I'm working on that started as my final Bachelor Project. This tool helps gamers manage their time and health better while gaming by giving several physical and mental health tips, as well as the ability to schedule and track training sessions.</p>
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>The process started with a deep research about the subject. A lot of people talk about gaming addiction being an issue, but not much is said over the competitive nature of gaming, and the mental and physical health that is closely related to this type of gaming. After conducting surveys it was made all the more clear that these aspects weren't highlighted enough.</p>
            <p>After this initial research and survey I made a list of features the replies of the survey mentioned, or could fix the issues the respondents mentioned. With these in mind I moved on to make a flow chart which would outline the general flow the program would use. Based on this flow chart I then made a low-fidelity prototype in Figma to test out if all parts and features could be accessed intuitively.</p>
            <p>After several tests I then made a mid-fidelity prototype which fixed some of the flow issues the program had, as well as improve on the features already in the program based on feedback from the tests.</p>
            <p>Afterwards a high-fidelity prototype was made, fixing the issues mentioned in the mid-fidelity tests, as well as adding the branding of the program. This branding was mostly based on "cool" coloring and "rounded" edges, because a common issue in the survey was toxicity and overall aggression while gaming. These colors and shapes bring calm which fit this program.</p>
            <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
            <p>A lot. I learned how to use Figma. I noticed how important research is towards developing an application, as well as how important the prototype testing is to find bugs ahead of time.</p>
