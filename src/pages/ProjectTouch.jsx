            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>This promotional website was part of a bigger project I had to do in school. This site was made in conjunction with a poster that had to be made with a completely arbitrary way of designing it.</p>
            <p>After a few attempts of finding different ways of making elements for graphical design of a poster with theme "touch", I ended up working with putting soap on plastic foil. By lighting it up with a flashlight from different angles I was able to create different elements to use in a poster design.</p>
            <p>The promotional site was made using the same elements as the poster. The simple idea behind it was to have the website be a one-pager, where the visitors had to "touch" the screen once to get all the info.</p>
            <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
            <p>In terms of the design of the poster, I learned that you can make graphical design out of literally anything. My connection between soap (washing hands) and "touch" ended up being a combination towards the making of this poster.</p>
            <p>In terms of technical aspects I further sharpened working with Photoshop, as well as sharpening my web development (primarily css) skills. I wanted to make the site as easy as possible and learned some easy animation tricks in the process.</p>
