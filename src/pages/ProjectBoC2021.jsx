            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>The annual Belgian osu! Cup was in need of graphics. More particularly a general theme, background and other graphical elements like a twitch overlay.</p>
            <p>The process to get towards the end product started with an initial research of other tournaments in the osu! community. Little bits of inspiration were taken to work towards a more monoline-type design.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, a color pallette was made based on less-saturated colors of the Belgian national flag. The font used was also in line with a monoline style.</p>
            <p>The rest of the design was made with trial and error. Same goes for the specific end-products that had to be made.</p>
            <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
            <p>I learned that less sometimes really is more. I sometimes made some prototypes too bombastic, which I then simplified afterwards to go for a more clean design in the end.</p>
