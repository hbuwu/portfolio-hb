            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>This website was made as part of a pop-up design agency a few classmates and I made for one of our subjects. The site showcases the work we had done for certain non-profit organizations.</p>
            <p>The site construction wasn't too complicated. We first made wireframes to make an initial design. Afterwards we programmed the site using HTML, CSS and JS and added content accordingly.</p>
            <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
            <p>This project was way more about <span className='highlightText'>teamwork</span>, rather than individual work. I had a blast working with my classmates on several projects, including building this website. The team atmosphere was great and it gave us an initial taste of how to work together as a design agency.</p>
